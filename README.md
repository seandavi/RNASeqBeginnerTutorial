This little "tutorial" is meant as a walkthrough (a bit dated now, but...) of the basics of RNA-seq, including describing file formats, quality control metrics, and how to visualize RNA-seq data in a genome viewer. The target audience is really the biologist who wants to learn a bit about the RNA-seq data that he or she is producing.
